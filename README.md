## Business Background
Central Park is a boutique co˙ee shop located in the heart of New York City. It serves a high-quality selection of co˙ee, food, tea and etc for customers. They believe their current customer base is fairly loyal and revenue are generating steadily year over year. Now, as the size of its customer base has reached more than 30K+, the store would like to explore their sales data and have a sense of their demands and customers. Hired as the data scientist consultants, our motivation is to better understand the customer purchase patterns of volume and items sold in the store, confirm whether their customer base is loyal with support from sales data, and smooth demands out over time.


## Our Task
Tasked by Central Park, our job is to normalize demand and generate additional revenue by finding appro-priate gap in the business and improve the business operation of our client.
